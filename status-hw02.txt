Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Kevin Sun

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
hw02.ksun.pw

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?
https://github.com/kevinsun242/CS4550-HW02

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
Most of the HTML down to JavaScript.
About half of the CSS down to Position

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
Fairly comfortable although this is still my first time using
them, I feel like I have a good reference to look up what
I need.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
About half of them.

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
So-so, as this is my first time working with JS.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
Yes

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had some trouble initially with getting the CSS with some things,
such as aligning the buttons to a grid in a table and getting them
to the size I wanted. This was mainly trial and error though as 
you can easily test the HTML page from a browser.

It also took a little time getting the logic of the calculator
working correctly and catching errors / edge cases. For example,
hitting multiple operators without any numbers in between or 
leading zeros when it's not a decimal would cause errors when
trying to evaluate the expression.
